							<h3>Position Description</h3>
							<p>ASD Strategic and International Policy Officer. This position within the Australian Signals Directorate would place me in a collaborative environment that would require complex problem-solving and a high level of team-work in a constantly developing environment. It is these requirements that make the position appealing to me, as there is also a requirement to have a good grasp of IT concepts to complement your understanding of the problems you’re trying to solve. </p>					
							<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience required</h3>
							<p>The skills required for this position would be vast, and not tied down to one particular skillset. Initiative would be required to seek out different skills or knowledge to assist in problem solving, whilst organisational skills will be required to ensure that all tasks are completed efficiently and in a flexible way if need be. The ability to understand large effects of actions is also required, as strategic level effects can happen as a result of low-level decisions. </p>
							<h3>Skills, qualifications and experience I have</h3>
							<p>I currently am employed in a job that requires me to problem solve on a daily basis, and seek information for problems I am unable to assist in solving. I operate a team on a daily basis and have an in-depth understanding on how to operate and maintain organisational wellbeing. My job exposes me to strategic decisions and effects, meaning that I infrequently have exposure to these decisions which has helped shape my understanding of them. </p>
							<h3>My plan on obtaining skills, qualifications and experience</h3>
							<p>I plan on completing the Bachelor of IT to have a greater understanding of IT concepts and specific tools workings, which will allow me to provide context if I was to work in this position. Further experience in my current job will allow me to get organisation specific understanding of the group, and allow for me to gain insight if I was to apply for the position. As I continue through Bach of IT, I will be able to continue building up my oral and written communication skills, which will be essential in continuing to develop interpersonal skills and organisational skills. </p>

							<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for me? </h3>
							<p>The test that had the most relevance to me was the Myer-Briggs Test, which I felt was a very accurate representation of the data presented. After reading into the meaning of the different types of attributes, it has made me more aware of how I may be perceived in the workplace, and whether the way I am is working how I want it to in my job. On the opposite side, I am quite comfortable with how the data presented potentially represents who I am as a person. The accuracy of online tests is always questionable, and I am confident that I do not need to make major attitude or life adjustments as a result of this. </p>
							<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team? </h3>
							<p>I think the results do more of a job confirming what I already know about my behaviour in a team, rather than influencing any potential future behavioural changes. I’m aware that I generally take on an extremely collaborative position in a team environment, and often struggle to contest ideas that team members may present with my own ideas. As I work in teams in the future, I will be continuously attempting to improve my contributions to the teams, and make my voice heard. </p>
							<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
							<p>When forming a team, I need to be aware that there may be team members who are more introverted or less collaborative than myself. If this does occur, I will need to consciously be aware of this and make a conscientious effort to be a bigger player in the team in order to get the most out of those quieter members. </p>
