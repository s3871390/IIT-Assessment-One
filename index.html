									<h3>What is my interest in IT? When did it start? </h3>
									<p>My main interest in IT is how communications fits into making the world a more connected place, and how IT fits into this. This interest ranges from communication mediums such as satellite links or submarine cables, to how interactive mediums such as the Internet conveys information between audiences. My interest in IT started when my Dad brought home a PlayStation 2 one night with Scooby Doo! Mystery Mayhem, and we started to play it together. From then on, I have always been interested in games in general, but further developed my interest into how they worked and conveyed the message that is being developed.  </p>

									<h3>What is my interest in IT? When did it start? (cont'd)</h3>
									<p>I took IT elective subjects as soon as I was able to in High School, and quite enjoyed being able to learn more in that environment. Unfortunately, a lot of the skills that I learnt in school aren’t applicable nowadays, and although I work within an IT related field for the ADF, I find myself re-learning a lot of concepts in this course.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
									<p>I chose to come to RMIT as the course subjects seemed to be best aligned to my interests, especially the subjects later on the course. RMIT also seemed to offer a more in-depth course compared to other institutes, and would allow me to complete the course close to 100% online, which is an essential factor in my studies. </p>

									<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies? </h3>
									<p>I’m expecting to learn both general toolsets that can be applied to generic problems that are experienced in the IT field, but also specific skills in applications and tools/programs which may be useful in future or different careers. Overall, my goal is to have a greater understanding of IT concepts whilst retaining skills in specific areas that can be drawn upon. </p>

							<h1>Project Idea</h1>
						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>	The IT project that I will be putting forward is a personalised website / bot that would work with a user to identify, compare, contrast and decide on the provision of items that would best suit the user’s physical sleep requirements. This website / bot would utilise several IT concepts, including a chatterbot like service to provide personalisation to the user, and a back-end interface to allow suppliers or companies to interact with to upload their products or advice. The end goal of this project would be to encompass as many sleep related items as possible, therefore allowing a greater level of comparison and customisation to the user when selecting products.</p> 					
						<h3>Motivation</h3>
						<p>According to the Sleep Health Foundation - 2016 Sleep Health Survey of Australian Adults, inadequate sleep through either quality or duration affects between 33 – 45% of adults, which is quite a large portion of the population. Whilst this can be attributed to things such as the advent of the ‘24/7 Society’ where there is activity at almost all times, or to having children, one variable that can be remedied is the use of effective sleep products. For the purpose of this report, products can mean things such as mattresses, pillows, earplugs, eye masks, and other item that is typically used with rest or sleep.</p>
						<h3>Description</h3>
						<p>The service will include a variety of features that will be designed to optimise the user’s experience in the comparison and selection phase of the products. These will be explored in-depth in the report, and include the following features: chatterbot integration to assist the user with frequently asked questions (FAQs) and product related questions, a company/supplier interface that allows for submission or alteration of products that will then be moderated by the website owners, and the actual user interface that will allow for the users to use the service for its purpose.</p>
						<h4>Chatterbot Integration</h4>
						<p>A chatterbot will be integrated into the service to provide a level of personalisation for the users, whilst also being able to field a modest level of FAQs, which can reduce the workload on a second level of support that would typically be manned by people. The chatterbot would be able to maintain a shopping list for users as they work their way through the website, and once the user has completed a survey to narrow the selection of products down to a personalised few, the chatterbot would then be able to make recommendations based on a user's requirement. This could be in relation to the stiffness of a certain type of mattress, whether it is electrically adjustable or not, or whether a pillow has orthopaedic like benefits for the user or not. </p>
						<h4>Company/supplier Interface </h4>
						<p>An option would be included in the account/options area of the website to switch to the company/supplier interface for the website. The idea behind this is to switch from the consumer interface of purchasing sleep products, to a more developmental area that allows companies or suppliers to add, subtract or alter products based on the company's needs. This interface would be accessed by registering an account with the website owners, providing verification through the form of an Australian Business Number, or other equivalent verification, and then being provided access to create product listings. For safety and security, all products once ready for submission would have to be reviewed by the website moderators to ensure that the products are suitable and fit for purpose in their selected sub-section. This will ensure that the website remains safe for use by all people, and that they will only be presented with sleep products that are applicable to their searches. Products on the website are not limited to one brand, and instead will be open to all brands providing they pass moderation. </p>
						<h4>User/consumer interface </h4>
						<p>The user interface will operate along the same functionality lines as many forms of online shopping sites currently available. The primary feature will be the personalisation function, which will take the user through a variety of questions that are specific to their sleep needs and feelings. After the function is completed, the results will then be applied to the relevant products that the user is searching for, with the results also being saved for the chatterbots use in the case of any further questions or customisation being needed by the user. If the user does not wish to conduct personalisation, there will be a menu option that allows the user to search products by brand, type of product, other features, etc. This will not provide options based on the personalisation, but still allows for all the variable and information taken from the personalisation to be manually selected by the user in this format. </p>
						<h3>Tools and Technologies </h3>
						<p>The software required to create this service would be primarily web-based, with further second and third level support such as supply chains and customer service requiring additional considerations that aren’t a part of this service. The chatterbot can be provided through writing or acquiring a chatterbot code, which can then be edited to suit the websites needs. The chatterbot can also be integrated into the website’s code as needed to ensure that data can be sent and received by the bot to facilitate the user’s needs. To complete the user and company interfaces, a purpose-built website would be needed with the ability to hold sections, sub-sections and linkages to different pages within the site. This will allow for viewing of different products, and can even utilise AJAX to allow for quick viewing of products if desired. </p>
						<h3>Skills Required </h3>
						<p>Several separate skills would be required to facilitate the development of the service, but should not require any specific or special hardware. The web code will need to be written and/or developed as mentioned in the tools to facilitate multiple pages, and allow for the integration of the chatterbot into the site. The chatterbot itself will require someone with intimate knowledge of the code the bot is written in, and also have the ability to allow for data to be sent and received by the bot to facilitate the user's needs. The acquisition of these skills or finding people with the required skills would not be a particularly demanding task, however to have a highly functioning product, it would be necessary to ensure that the skills are of a high level. </p>
						<h3>Outcome</h3>
						<p>If this project was to be successful, users will have the ability to compare and contrast different sleeping products against each other to facilitate an improved sleeping experience. They will be less likely to have to travel to different sites or stores for specialist advice in different areas, i.e. mattresses and pillows. Whilst this will be unlikely to solve the problem of a large number of adults lacking quality or length of sleep, it will assist users in being able to access a vast range of sleeping products in one place, with a personalisation service to ensure the products are best suited to the user. This development would primarily provide ease of access and comparison of sleeping products to users, and help with product selection. </p>
